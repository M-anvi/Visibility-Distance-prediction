ðŸ“Š Visibility Distance Prediction

This project focuses on predicting visibility distance using weather-related data. Visibility is crucial for air traffic control to ensure safe flight operations. The dataset includes features like temperature, humidity, pressure, wind direction, and precipitation.

ðŸ”‘ Key Highlights

Performed data preprocessing including train-test split and feature scaling using StandardScaler.

Selected relevant features and dropped redundant ones.

Implemented various regression models such as Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

Applied GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning of the Linear Regression model.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset was collected from public meteorological repositories and aviation data sources for weather tracking purposes.
